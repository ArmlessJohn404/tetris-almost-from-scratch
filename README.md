# TETRIS ALMOST FROM SCRATCH
This is an attempt of making the game [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) using modern programming languages. The idea is to time the development and track the progress and the time it took to get in each stage in this document. If possible I want to finish this project in under 12 h.

Tetris is the first software to be exported from the USSR to the US and became and not only became one of the most famous computer games, it has been released for nearly every videogame console and computer operating system.

For this project, I'll be using the engine built for the [hamurabi-almost-from-scratch](https://github.com/ArmlessJohn404/hamurabi-almost-from-scratch). I'll try to improve it and try to draw only characters on screen. The idea is to simulate the original game and also show an improved view using the same engine.

The game is based in html5/canvas, CSS and ES6 javascript.

## Progress reports
00:00 - START! Well, now it's 6th of June 2017 and I'm a little drunk already. I'm not going to work that much today but at least it's a beginning.

## 00:30 - Copied files from HAMURABI project and hosted the page
Well, I'm quite slow today, but the foundations have been built. The game should be available already using [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## 00:45 - Cleanup the old game
It was quite easy to cleanup the old game, now we have a clean canvas to start working.
